I managed my application with **Flutter Bloc**, which is a **State Management** package. I made my **LiveQuery** connection with **Flutter Parse Server SDK package**. After the data processed in the API reaches Parse Server, my application receives feedback.Thus, it turns into a real-time application.[My Nodejs API is here](https://github.com/endmr11/nodejs-parse)
